The website allows you to create custom layers by modifying predefined vertex and fragment shaders. You can also inspect the exact value calculated at the specific location simply by hovering the cursor over the selected pixel.

The project is written in: TypeScript + React.js + WebGL + [Ace editor](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace).
